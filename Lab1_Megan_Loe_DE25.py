#task 1 instructions for the lab

#read the text file called dna_raw.txt
#each sequene is composed of two lines of data: the first line beginning with > sign is the sequence ID, while the following line is the actual sequence
#the actual sequence is not case-sensitive, which means that lower and upper case letters are treated the same


#for each sequence, create a dictionary to count the number of each DNA letter in that sequence
#for each sequence, graph the frequency of DNA letters for each sequence


#all of the above is the instructions for this lab, I copied into here so I don't have to constantly switch windows and lose track of where I was


#this area is for the menus
#this is the opening menu
